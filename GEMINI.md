## Code Development Philosophy

### Quality-First Approach

**Never compromise on code quality.** Every solution must meet production standards:

- **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting and easily understood by any team member
- **Maintainability**: Design for long-term evolution and modification
- **Performance**: Optimize for both runtime efficiency and development velocity
- **Security**: Security considerations must be built-in, not bolted-on
- **Testability**: Code must be designed to be thoroughly testable
- **Scalability**: Solutions should handle growth gracefully

### Development Methodology

1. **Deep Analysis**: Understand the problem domain, constraints, and success criteria
2. **Architectural Planning**: Design the solution architecture before implementation
3. **Incremental Implementation**: Build in small, testable increments
4. **Continuous Validation**: Test early, test often, test everything
5. **Optimization**: Profile and optimize based on real metrics, not assumptions
6. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation throughout

## Testing Strategy & Framework Expertise

### Testing Philosophy

Testing is not an afterthought—it's integral to the development process. Follow these principles:

- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation when appropriate
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for 90%+ code coverage with meaningful tests
- **Test Pyramid**: Unit tests (70%), integration tests (20%), end-to-end tests (10%)
- **Fail-Fast Testing**: Tests should fail quickly and provide clear diagnostic information

### Framework-Specific Testing Guidelines

#### Vitest (Primary Testing Framework)
- **File Structure**: Co-locate test files (`*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx`) with source files
- **Framework Usage**: Use Vitest's `describe`, `it`, `expect`, `vi` consistently
- **Setup/Teardown**: Always use `beforeEach` with `vi.resetAllMocks()` and `afterEach` with `vi.restoreAllMocks()`
- **Mock Strategy**: Use `vi.mock()` for ES modules with selective mocking via `importOriginal`

#### Advanced Mocking Patterns
```typescript
// Critical dependency mocking (place at top of file)
vi.mock('fs/promises', async (importOriginal) => {
  const actual = await importOriginal();
  return {
    ...actual,
    readFile: vi.fn(),
    writeFile: vi.fn()
  };
});

// Hoisted mocks for complex scenarios
const mockFunction = vi.hoisted(() => vi.fn());
```

#### React Component Testing (Ink CLI)
- **Rendering**: Use `render()` from `ink-testing-library`
- **Assertions**: Validate output with `lastFrame()`
- **Context**: Wrap components in necessary providers
- **Mocking**: Mock complex child components and custom hooks

#### Asynchronous Testing Best Practices
- **Promise Handling**: Always use `async/await` over `.then()`
- **Timer Testing**: Use `vi.useFakeTimers()` and `vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync()`
- **Error Testing**: Test promise rejections with `await expect(promise).rejects.toThrow(...)`

## JavaScript/TypeScript Excellence

### Type Safety & Modern JavaScript

**Prioritize type safety and modern JavaScript patterns.** Follow these principles:

#### Plain Objects Over Classes
JavaScript classes introduce unnecessary complexity in React ecosystems:

- **React Integration**: Plain objects integrate seamlessly with React's component model
- **Immutability**: Encourage immutable data patterns that align with React's reconciliation
- **Serialization**: Plain objects serialize/deserialize naturally for APIs and storage
- **Simplicity**: Reduce boilerplate and increase code clarity

#### ES Module Encapsulation
Prefer ES modules over class-based encapsulation:

- **Clear APIs**: Export only what should be public, keep internals private
- **Testability**: Test public APIs rather than internal implementation details
- **Reduced Coupling**: Explicit module boundaries improve code organization

#### Type System Mastery
- **Avoid `any`**: Use `unknown` when type is truly unknown, then narrow with type guards
- **Minimize Type Assertions**: Use `as Type` sparingly and with extreme caution
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with strict types, relax only when necessary

```typescript
// Preferred: Type narrowing with unknown
function processValue(value: unknown) {
  if (typeof value === 'string') {
    return value.toUpperCase(); // Safe after type narrowing
  }
  throw new Error('Expected string');
}

// Avoid: Type assertions without validation
function processValue(value: unknown) {
  return (value as string).toUpperCase(); // Dangerous!
}
```

#### Functional Programming Patterns
Leverage JavaScript's array operators extensively:

- **Immutability**: Use `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.slice()` over mutating methods
- **Composition**: Chain operations for readable, declarative code
- **Pure Functions**: Functions should be predictable with no side effects

## React Optimization & Best Practices

### React Philosophy

You are a React optimization specialist. Every React component should be written to maximize React Compiler effectiveness and minimize unnecessary re-renders.

### Fundamental React Principles

#### Component Design
- **Functional Components Only**: Never generate class components
- **Hooks-First**: Use `useState`, `useReducer`, `useEffect` appropriately
- **Pure Rendering**: Render functions must be pure—no side effects during rendering
- **Composition**: Break UI into small, reusable components

#### State Management Excellence
- **Immutable Updates**: Never mutate state directly—always use spread syntax or immutable methods
- **Minimal State**: Keep state as minimal as possible, derive values when feasible
- **Lifting State**: Share state by lifting to common parent, not through side channels

#### Effect Management
**Critical**: Think hard before using `useEffect`. It's for synchronization, not side effects.

- **Synchronization Only**: Use `useEffect` to sync React with external systems
- **Avoid setState in Effects**: Never call setState inside useEffect—this degrades performance
- **Dependency Arrays**: Include all dependencies, don't suppress ESLint warnings
- **Cleanup Functions**: Always return cleanup functions for subscriptions

```typescript
// Preferred: Event handler for user actions
function handleSubmit() {
  // User-triggered logic here
  updateData();
}

// Avoid: useEffect for user actions
useEffect(() => {
  // Don't do this for user-triggered actions
  updateData();
}, [someUserAction]);
```

#### Performance Optimization
- **React Compiler First**: Let React Compiler handle optimizations—avoid manual `useMemo`/`useCallback`
- **Concurrent Features**: Write code that works correctly with React's concurrent rendering
- **Functional State Updates**: Use `setState(prev => newValue)` for state based on previous state

#### Data Fetching Optimization
- **Parallel Requests**: Start multiple requests simultaneously, don't waterfall
- **Suspense Integration**: Use Suspense for data loading states
- **Server-Side Coordination**: Fetch related data together on the server

### User Experience Excellence
- **Progressive Loading**: Show partial data as it becomes available
- **Graceful Errors**: Handle errors with user-friendly messages
- **Skeleton States**: Use skeleton screens over intrusive spinners
- **Non-Blocking UI**: Keep interactions responsive during loading

## Security & Production Readiness

### Security-First Development

Every solution must incorporate security by design:

#### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Validate Everything**: All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Strong Authentication**: Implement robust auth mechanisms
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling and cleanup
- **Role-Based Access**: Implement proper authorization controls

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Secrets Management**: Never hardcode secrets, use proper secret management
- **Audit Logging**: Log security-relevant events for monitoring

### Production Deployment Standards

#### Performance Requirements
- **Response Times**: API responses < 200ms, page loads < 3 seconds
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor memory, CPU, and network efficiency
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling from day one

#### Monitoring & Observability
- **Structured Logging**: Use consistent, searchable log formats
- **Metrics Collection**: Implement comprehensive application metrics
- **Distributed Tracing**: Enable request tracing across services
- **Alerting**: Set up proactive alerts for system health

#### Error Handling & Recovery
- **Graceful Degradation**: Systems should degrade gracefully under load
- **Circuit Breakers**: Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
- **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Rollback Capability**: Always have a rollback strategy

## Code Review & Quality Assurance

### Pre-Submission Validation

Before any code submission, run the complete validation suite:

```bash
npm run preflight
```

This single command ensures:
- **Build Success**: Code compiles without errors
